    1. Google AI overview used to find the "to_string()" function with the Google search "how to convert double to string c++" (does not provide any sources)

Summary:
    Overall programming my program was relatively straightforward. 
    I had an issue with the task compiling, which I was able to fix myself via trial and error (Google wasn't helpful).
    The most challenging part was figuring out how to convert a double input into a string to initialize a new rod.
        I tried using the "to_string()" function which did not set the correct precision automatically, so I had to
        append it to a seperate string using the correct precision. I used a for loop along with 2 buffer strings in
        order to input the number correctly exactly as it was inputted. While it is not the most elegant solution,
        it works completely fine based on my testing, and it can output up to the first 6 decimal places 
        (this seems to be an issue with "to_string()" and not the program), which is more than accurate enough for
        any piece of stock in most commonly units.
    I had plenty of time to finish the high level requirements.
